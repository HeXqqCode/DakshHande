        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello, I'm Daksh Hande, a commerce student currently in class 12th. Graduating in 2023-24 with my final exams on March 4, 2024. I'm passionate about chess, holding one trophy and numerous certificates, with a FIDE rating of 1060 in rapid chess. I've also dabbled in programming, completing a core Python course and working on various Python projects. Aspiring to become a cabin crew member, my ultimate goal is to settle permanently in the U.S. after gaining experience in the aviation industry.</p>
